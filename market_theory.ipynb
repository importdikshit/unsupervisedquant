    "\n",
    "􏰀 How do we get the equilibrium price?\n",
    "\n",
    "􏰀 Is the “price recipe” the same for all markets?\n",
    "\n",
    "􏰀 What if the price is not the only parameter driving individuals’ decisions?\n",
    "What if there’s no price? (no monetary transactions between sellers and buyers)\n",
    "\n",
    "􏰀 What if the price is “shared”? (e.g., roommates sharing a rent)\n",

    "ORGANS - No money involved whatsoever. \n",
    "\n",
    "WHAT MARKETS NEED TO WORK:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Thickness: Enough actors on both sides, better knowledge of demand/supply. \n",
    "2. No Congestion - Too many choices on both sides. \n",
    "3. Safe - Infomration about rules, avoid feeling ripped off.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WHEAT - Not exactly identical. \n",
    "1. The commodity itself affects the behavior. How it is defined. Features. \n",

    "FOOD Bank Example: TWO IMPORTANT ISSUES. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract Information from the Markets. \n",

    "4. Incentives in the existing model lead to negative externalities. \n",
    "5. We want them to accept food from FA\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Design:\n",
    "1. Two auctions per day - First Price - Sealed Bid - This has benefits. \n",
    "2. Shares are redistributed according to the maintained weighting. \n",
    "3. Joint Bidding\n",
    "4. Delegated Bidding \n",
    "5. Credit. \n",
