Notes of an Unsupervised Quant
============================

An attempt to maintain my sanity during quarantine and beyond.

This work is getting slightly repetitive and I want to keep my edge in this domain in some mildly systematic manner. 

Here is an aspirational and basic structure for this project. 
An estimated timeline of completion is sometime in the next couple of decades. 

I've never taken structured notes in my life before. 
### THIS IS GOING TO BE BUILT BY A PROCESS OF ITERATION ~ 3
SHIT BUT STRUCTURED -> STRUCTURED AND QUANTITY -> STRUCTURED AND POLISHED

4 Basic things in every section

High level Results Summarized - Functional shit on every topic below
Deriviations and Proofs wherever we have a non-obvious result. (All in Sharpie)
